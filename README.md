# Java_Projects
Small projects that show some of the things I've learned in Java throughout my education.


## CIS_212_Projects
This folder contains multiple projects that were completed in Java during my studies at the University of Oregon. CIS 212 is third course in a three course series that introduces students into the topic of Computer Science via programming languages.

## CMSC_350_Projects
This folder contains four projects that were completed in Java during an online course from University of Maryland University College. CMSC 350 was a course on data structures and algorithms, so all of the projects are implementing some data structure or algorithm using Java.
